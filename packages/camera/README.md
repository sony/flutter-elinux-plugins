# camera_elinux

The implementation of the camera plugin for flutter elinux. APIs are designed to be API compatible with the the official [`camera`](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/camera).

## Required libraries

This plugin uses [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) internally.

```Shell
$ sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev
# Install as needed.
$ sudo apt install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav
```

## Usage

### pubspec.yaml
```yaml
dependencies:
  camera: ^0.10.0+1
  camera_elinux:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/sony/flutter-elinux-plugins.git
      path: packages/camera
      ref: main
```

### Source code
Import `camera` in your Dart code:
```dart
import 'package:camera/camera.dart';
```

### Customize for your target devices
If you this plugin on your target devices, you will need to customize the pipeline in the source file.So, replace the `videoconvert` element with a H/W accelerated element of your target device to perform well.

#### default:
camerabin viewfinder-sink="videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=RGBA ! fakesink"

#### e.g. customization for i.MX 8M platforms:
camerabin viewfinder-sink="imxvideoconvert_g2d ! video/x-raw,format=RGBA ! fakesink"


## Troubleshooting

If you get the following error:
```Shell
Wrong JPEG library version: library is 62, caller expects 80
```

, try the following:
```Shell
sudo mv /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstjpeg.so \
        /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstjpeg.so.org
```
